Folder containing images to upload to openstack used in the demo

required:
  - debian.qcow2
  - fortios604.qcow2 (version 6.04 used and tested for the demo)

By default, the web server image is named debian.qcow2.
The image must be cloud-init (sudo apt install cloud-init on debian) & qemu (qcow2) compatible
For the purpose of the SecDays demo, we used a debian disto with nginx preinstall to save boot/configuration time
Once download with get_images.sh, guestfish tool was used to modified the image to install nginx
